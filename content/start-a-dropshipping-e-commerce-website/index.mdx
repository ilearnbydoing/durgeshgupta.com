## What is dropshipping?

You start selling without any inventory, and your order will be fulfilled by a third-party vendor on your behalf, all white-labelled.
An example is how dropshipping works in the real world.
Let's take an example: you want to sell a pen, so you will source it from a dropshipping provider for Rs. 10, and of course you will sell it to the end customer for an approximately higher price, say Rs. 15. This way, you will be making a profit of Rs. 5 on your order. Once the customs order is placed, the pen vendor associated with the dropshipping provider will be notified and will ship the ordered pen to the shipping address provided by the customer. Once the order is successfully fulfilled and has passed the return/exchange window, the profit margin of Rs. 5 will be settled in your linked bank account through your preferred payment mode.

## Who offers dropshipping?

There are numerous drop-shipping service providers, and you can tie up with any of them based on their offerings. Some of them offer free membership, and some do charge to be associated with them. Globally, some of the best online dropshipping service providers are Spocket, Trendsi, Oberlo, CJDropshipping, etc.
