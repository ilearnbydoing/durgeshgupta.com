In Laravel 10 when you run

```
php artisan storage:link
```

if you encounter an issue where your storage directory is already linked and exist, it usually means that the symbolic link from the storage directory to the **public/storage directory already exists**. Laravel typically creates this symbolic link during the installation process to allow easy access to uploaded files.

## How to fix The [public/storage] link already exists?

**To resolve this issue, you have a few options:**

**Delete the Existing Symbolic Link:**

You can manually delete the existing symbolic link and then recreate it using the **php artisan storage:link** command. Here are the steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your Laravel project.

Delete the existing symbolic link by running:

```
rm public/storage
```

**Recreate the symbolic link by running:**

```
php artisan storage:link
```

This command will create a new symbolic link from the public/storage directory to the storage/app/public directory.

**Check for Permission Issues:**
If you are still facing issues, it might be related to file permissions. Ensure that the directories and files in the storage and public/storage directories have appropriate read and write permissions for the web server user (usually www-data or nginx). You can use the chmod command to adjust permissions if necessary.

**Manually Create the Symbolic Link:**
If the php artisan storage:link command does not work for some reason, you can manually create the symbolic link using the ln command:

Open your terminal.

Navigate to your project's root directory.

**Run the following command:**

```
ln -s ../storage/app/public public/storage
```

This command creates a symbolic link from public/storage to storage/app/public.

After performing one of these actions, you should be able to access your storage files via the public/storage URL without encountering the "already linked" error. Make sure to clear your browser cache if you were previously experiencing issues.
