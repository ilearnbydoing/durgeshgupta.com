[Pretty Cakes](https://www.prettycake.in/) is an online cake store that sells cake and other freshly baked products. Currently, they are serving in Ambarnath.

So in case you are living in Ambarnath go ahead and place the order to get freshly baked custom designed cake and other products.

[PrettyCake.in](http://PrettyCakes.co.in) the website is developed by me. So let's explore more about it.

## How PrettyCake.in is built?

I built it using Shopify and Nextjs, The [prettycake.in](http://prettycakes.co.in) is completely serverless application that means I am not using any paid server upfront and currently it is effectively free thanks to Vercel the online cloud hosting platform for serverless apps. I used Shopify because it is easy to manage the products data i.e. title, images, product variants, pricing etc. So for the backend, I am using Shopify and for the frontend, I am using Nextjs.

## Is not Shopify costly?

Well, I just use its storefront API and also I have another backend alternative custom built-in Laravel for my client. So we can easily get away with Shopify too and can manage backend data efficiently without Shopify.

## Why Nextjs?

Nextjs is one of the leading and most popular frontend frameworks based on react to build modern websites and apps. It is fast, secure and efficient and loved by search engines like Google etc.

## Whatsapp Checkout - How does it work?

For startup and local business stores like [PrettyCake.in](https://www.prettycake.in/) it is not required to have a payment gateway on the website instead I preferred to use Whatsapp chat in order to let customers place their order.

[PrettyCake.in](https://www.prettycake.in/) display the products on the website for ordering buyer will add the product into the cart and will place the order on owner Whatsapp chat, well that's sound like the semi-manual process to get new order but that's effective in this particular business use case, the buyer can ask for the availability of the cake and can customize the cake as per their requirement and once deal finalised owner can share his/her google pay link or any other UPI link to let the buyer make the payment. This way, while taking payment from customers directly into their bank account without any middleman like payment processor the owner also saves payment transaction charges.
